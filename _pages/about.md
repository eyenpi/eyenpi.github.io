I recently completed my **Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Guilan**. During my studies, I developed a keen interest in the field of **machine learning** and its diverse applications. Currently, I am working as an **undergraduate research assistant**, exploring the use of machine learning techniques in interdisciplinary domains such as **biomedical engineering and agriculture**.

My primary research interests revolve around **natural language processing (NLP)** and the application of **large language models (LLMs)**. I am actively engaged in studying methods to fine-tune and optimize their performance. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms to tackle challenges in various fields.
