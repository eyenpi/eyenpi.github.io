I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Guilan. During my studies, I developed an interest in **machine learning** and its applications. I'm now a **master's student at Polimi**, continuing to expand my knowledge and skills in this field. Currently, I am working as a **graduate research assistant**, exploring the use of machine learning techniques in interdisciplinary domains such as **biomedical engineering and AI in healthcare**.

I'm particularly interested in **natural language processing (NLP)** and **large language models (LLMs)**. I am actively engaged in studying methods to fine-tune and optimize their performance. My primary research interests revolve around the **application of LLMs**.
